# Introduction to Angular 2

Source Code for Introduction to Angular 2

## Getting Started

- Make sure you have Node installed.
- Run `npm install` in this folder.
- You can start a server in this folder by running `PORT=8080 node bin/server` or  `npm start`. The server is a static server that serves static files. You can also create endpoints in `bin/server`. There is already an example for a fake endpoint called `/api`.
- Alternatively you should provide your own server to serve the files for each project or run `live-server project-files/<project-name>`
