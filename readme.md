# Introduction to Angular2

Source Code for Introduction to Angular2

## Getting Started

- Make sure that you have Node installed.
- In this folder run `npm install` to install the shared dependencies for the projects. It will also install the dev server to serve the sample projects.
- Then run `PORT=8080 node bin/server` to start the server. Alternatively, you can do `npm start`
- You can navigate to `project-files` and view any of the projects. So for example, if you want to see the `starter` project, start the server and then in the browser go to `project-files > starter > index.html`
- Note that you can use the starter project as the most basic boilerplate code to play around with Angular.
